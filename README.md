# summle-solver

This is a simple script to find solutions to [Summle challenges](https://summle.net/).

## Usage

```
python summle.py <target number> <list of input numbers>
```

## TODO

- add unit tests
- Make output easier to read
- (longer term) represent formulas as binary trees (rather than strings) to allow for different formatting options, de-duplication of similar solutions e.g. (10 + 2) + 3 vs 10 + (3 + 2) vs (10 + 3) + 2
- improve performance
